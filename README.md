## Essential references
* [plan for development]
* [user stories](https://github.com/EricLScace/allthemats-ember/wiki/user-stories)

## Changes from v0.1
* Ember client
* Database of matrices expanded from the v0.1 test set of 40 matrices to the full 2,907 matrix listing previously compiled by Linotype staff.
* User stories expanded: user can search not only for a specific Linotype matrix code, but also for all matrices that meet search criteria; e.g., Helvetica bold in 8 pt to 10 pt sizes.
* ERD changed to optimize size of database, and to accommodate more edge cases in the description and use of Linotype matrices.
